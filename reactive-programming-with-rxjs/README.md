# Reactive Programming with RxJS

RxJS, the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript, is a set of libraries that give us powerful tools for managing concurrency in our applications. Using RxJS, we use Observables to represent asynchronous data streams and then query those streams using one or more of the many available operators. In this talk, we'll create some simple examples to explore what Observables are and how to use them. Along the way, we'll compare and contrast Observables to the other familiar tools in our JavaScript developer's toolbox: event listeners, callbacks, and promises. We'll also look at an Angular 2 example, which favors using Observables over promises.
